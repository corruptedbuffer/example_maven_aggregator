This example Maven multi-module project demonstrates how Maven can fail to build a
correct website for a multi-module project.  For some reason, there are no links generated for
Project1 and Project2 on the main page, just bold text.

To test this, you'll have to change the site to deploy to in the upper level POM, then run:

mvn site-deploy

My hope is someone can tell me if I'm doing something wrong here, or if it's an actual bug.
I should point out that this happens with Maven 3 as well as Maven 2.
